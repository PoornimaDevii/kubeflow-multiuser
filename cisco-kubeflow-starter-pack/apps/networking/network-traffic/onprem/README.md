# Problem statement

Given a dataset of network traffic flow generated by  CICFlowMeter, predict whether the traffic flow is malicious or not i.e *Bot or Benign*.

## Dataset details

The dataset is available at -

https://cse-cic-ids2018.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/Processed+Traffic+Data+for+ML+Algorithms/Friday-02-03-2018_TrafficForML_CICFlowMeter.csv

Features extracted from the captured traffic using CICFlowMeter-V3 = 80
Flows labelled as - Bot or Benign

# Solution approach

After removal of noise/unwarranted features, number of feature columns chosen:  10.
Size of data set: 10000

## Tensorflow details

The model is developed using TensorFlow's DNNClassifier. This classifier builds a feed forward multilayer neural network that is trained on a set of labeled data in order to perform classification on similar, unlabeled data.

## Building, training and evaluating the neural network

The DNNClassifier requires feature columns (input layer), the architecture of the neural network (hidden layers) and the number of classes (output layer) to be specified. Consequently, input columns in the dataset are mapped directly to feature columns(input layer); _3_ hidden layers each with _13_, _65_ and _110_ neurons/nodes respectively were used; and, the output layer has _2_ classes, which classifies the location.
