# BLERSSI Location Prediction using Kubeflow Fairing 

## What we're going to build

Train & Save a BLERSSI location model using Kubeflow Fairing from jupyter notebook. Then, deploy the trained model to Kubeflow for Predictions.


## Infrastructure Used

* Cisco UCS - C240


## Setup

### Create Jupyter Notebook Server

Follow the [steps](./../notebook#create--connect-to-jupyter-notebook-server) to create & connect to Jupyter Notebook Server in Kubeflow

### Upload BLERSSI-Classification-fairing.ipynb file

Upload [BLERSSI-Classification-fairing.ipynb](BLERSSI-Classification-fairing.ipynb) to notebook server.

### Run BLERSSI Notebook

Open the BLERSSI-Classification-fairing.ipynb file and run notebook

### Configure Docker Registry credentials

### Create requirements.txt with require python packages

### Import Fairing Packages

### Get minio-service cluster IP to upload docker build context

Note: Please change DOCKER_REGISTRY to the registry for which you've configured credentials. Built training image are pushed to this registry.

### Create config-map to map your own docker credentials from created config.json

Note: create configmap named "docker-config". If already exists, delete existing one and create new configmap.

* Delete existing configmap

```
kubectl delete configmap -n $namespace docker-config
```

### Build docker image for the model
Note: Upload dataset, Dockerfile, and blerssi-model.py into notebook.
Builder builds training image using input files, an output_map - a map from source location to the location inside the context, and pushes it to the registry.

### Create Katib Experiment
Use Katib for automated tuning of your machine learning (ML) modelâ€™s hyperparameters and architecture.

### Wait for Katib Experiment Succeeded

### View the results of the experiment in the Katib UI

[Click here](Katib.md) to view the results of the katib experiment.

### Get Optimal Hyperparameters

### Define TFJob Class to create training job

### Define Blerssi class to be used by Kubeflow fairing

Note: Must necessarily contain train() and predict() methods

### Train Blerssi model on Kubeflow

Kubeflow Fairing packages the BlerssiServe class, the training data, and requirements.txt as a Docker image. 
It then builds & runs the training job on Kubeflow.

### Predict location for data using prediction endpoint

Change endpoint in the curl command to previous cell output, before executing location prediction.
